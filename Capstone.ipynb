    "With almost 9 millions people in 2020, London is a big city. Not only is it the capital of the United Kingdom, it is also one of the top financial places in Europe, and a hugely touristic city.\n",

    "With that in mind, what could possibly leverage a young entrepreneur looking to start his Food-Truck in London, if he wanted to be successful? What is the most prevalent types of shops? Where are located the _hot_ zone of the city? Which place would be best to maximize his profit?\n",

    "Then, we will use Python libraries to link each Neighborhoods to its relative geographical coordinates.\n",

    "After that, we will leverage the Foursquare location data to retrieve their attributes, cluster zones, and most importantly come up with suggestions on the best places to install a food truck.\n",
